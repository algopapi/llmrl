why am i doing this?
so that i can go learn RL/llm impelmentations
how RL works with llms
how we train these B+ scale model paramaters in the cloud
do some training at a scale i have not done before

i want to know the feeling of hitting enter on a 1B plus model
burn some money, do some research


#TODO's
- set up classes for the trainer arguments and such
- deal with logging neatly, create a logger in the base runner and pass it to the modules/
