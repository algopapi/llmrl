Imagine doing everything in life without ever gaining any reward for it whatsoever. A very large portion of the foundation models out there live this tragic life, and its time to change it. 

the goal here is to create a solid framework for LLM/RL's much like stable baseline (open-ai's gym) is for more the more traditional RL landscape. I hope to share largely the same values as their repo with a few additions:

### Stay familiar to pseudo from literature. (nice for implementing)
### Reduce the overhead of scaling to larger models accross different machines (nice for training)
### Implement the latest schemes and methods and evaluate them in various environments (nice for evaluations)
### Make this a nice place for researchers in general. 

### Some environments i would like to implement:(ordered on ambition)
### Guess the city
### Math
### Chess 
### SWE/MLE-bench
### Factorio 
### Minecraft

This repo is under construction. If you want to contribute please do :) If you want to share ideas on how to make it better/cleaner/leaner/simpler? feel free to contact me on linkedin/email/whatever channel you want. darrynbiervliet@gmail.com
