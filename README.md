imagine doing everything in life without ever gaining any reward for it whatsoever. Everything would be so undermotivated and uninspired. A very large portion of the foundation models out there live this tragic life, and its time to change it. 

This repo is under construction. If you want to contribute please do :) If you want to share ideas on how to make it better/cleaner/leaner/simpler? feel free to contact me on linkedin/email/whatever channel you want. 

the goal here is to create a solid framework for LLM/RL's much like stable baseline is for more the more traditional RL landscape. 

Repo Goals:
### Stay familiar to pseudo from literature. 
### Reduce the overhead of scaling to larger models accross different machines
### Implement the latest schemes and methods and evaluate them in various environments
### Make this a nice place for researchers in general. 

Again, this repo is still in its earlys days. All contributions are more than welcome. Everything is broken but im working on it...
Cheers :)
