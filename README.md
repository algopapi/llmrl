# LLM Reinforcement Learning Framework

Imagine doing everything in life without ever gaining any reward for it whatsoever. A very large portion of the foundation models out there live this tragic life, and its time to change it. 

The goal here is to create a solid framework for LLM/RL's much like stable baseline (open-ai's gym) is for more the more traditional RL landscape. I hope to share largely the same values as their repo with a few additions:

## Core Values

- Stay familiar to pseudo from literature. (nice for implementing)
- Reduce the overhead of scaling to larger models accross different machines (nice for training)
- Implement the latest schemes and methods and evaluate them in various environments (nice for evaluations)
- Make this a nice place for researchers in general. 

## Planned Environments
(ordered on ambition)

1. Guess the city
2. Math
3. Chess 
4. SWE/MLE-bench
5. Factorio 
6. Minecraft
