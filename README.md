This repo is under construction. If you want to contribute please do :) If you want to share ideas on how to make it better/cleaner/leaner/simpler? contact me on linkedin/email. 

the goal here is to create a solid framework for LLM/RL's much like stable baseline is for more the more traditional RL landscape. 

Repo Goals:

### Stay familiar to pseudo from literature. 
### Reduce the overhead of scaling to larger models accross different machines
### Impelment the latest schemes and methods and evaluate them in various environments
### Make this a nice place for researchers to try and evaluate their schemes

Again, this repo is still in its earlys days. All contributions are more than welcome. Everything is broken but im working on it... If you have requests/ideas on how to make this better feel more than free to contact me: darrynbiervliet@gmail.com
